# compete
I'm trying to pass over the comprehensive guide into competitve programming. Most problems are from UVa and ICPC Live Archive. After solving tough problems I usually try to explore some other people' code to compare and improve mine. Sometimes there are no representative coded solutions and I will share my own.
