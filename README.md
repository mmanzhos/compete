# Competitive programming
I'm trying to pass over [the comprehensive guide](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/myteaching/competitive_programming/cp1.pdf) into competitve programming.
Most problems are from UVa and ICPC Live Archive. After solving tough problems I usually try to explore some other people' code to compare and improve mine. Sometimes there are no representative coded solutions and I will share my own.
